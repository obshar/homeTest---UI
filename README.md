# homeTest---UI

Pre-requisites - 

JDK8

Make sure your browser executables are in the PATH of the system. For example, if you want to use chrome you need to add it to your PATH. Otherwise you will get exceptions when running the tests. Path for executables: /usr/local/bin/ (example: /usr/local/bin/chromedriver)

Page Objects Pattern
page object pattern is used to have reusable WebElements/small helper methods separated from actual test classes and give the opportunity to have nice structured and easily readable tests.
